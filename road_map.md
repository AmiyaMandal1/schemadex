## Pre-flight checklist (before M0)

**Naming & namespace**
- [x] Verify `schemadex` available on PyPI (`pip search` is dead — use https://pypi.org/project/schemadex/) *(was 404 → now claimed by us; 0.1.0 + 0.1.1 live.)*
- [x] Verify `schemadex` available as GitHub repo + create empty repo with README stub
- [x] Verify on crates.io directly (search confirmed clear, but `cargo publish --dry-run` is the real check) *(HTTP 404 on both `schemadex` and `schemadex-core`; `cargo publish --dry-run -p schemadex-core` packaged + verified cleanly.)*
- [x] ~~Reserve `@schemadex` on Twitter/X if you plan to announce there~~ *(skipped — no public announce planned.)*
- [x] Decide tagline (one line): *"Schema introspection and resolution toolkit for SQL agents"*

**Decisions to lock now (don't revisit during build)**
- [x] License: MIT OR Apache-2.0 (dual, Rust ecosystem norm)
- [x] MSRV: Rust 1.80+ (bumped from 1.75 — Cargo.lock format v4 requires ≥1.78; pinned to 1.80 for headroom)
- [x] Python support: 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
- [x] Workspace layout: `crates/schemadex-core/`, `crates/schemadex-py/`, `examples/`, `benches/`
- [x] PyPI distribution name: `schemadex` (single package, not split per backend)
- [x] Backend feature flags: `postgres`, `sqlite`, `duckdb` — none default-on, force opt-in
- [x] Async runtime: `tokio` only (don't try to be runtime-agnostic, it's a tarpit)
- [x] Cache location: `dirs::cache_dir()/schemadex/` on all platforms

**Repo hygiene**
- [x] `.gitignore` for Rust + Python + maturin artifacts
- [x] `CONTRIBUTING.md` even if it just says "open an issue first"
- [x] `SECURITY.md` pointing at GitHub security advisories (matters for a DB tool)
- [x] `CHANGELOG.md` with Keep-a-Changelog format, start with `## [Unreleased]`
- [x] Issue templates for bug + feature (copy from `bm25-rs`)
- [x] PR template requiring tests + changelog entry
- [x] `schemadex` name verified available on PyPI (HTTP 404 on `https://pypi.org/pypi/schemadex/json`) and crates.io (404 on `crates.io/api/v1/crates/schemadex` + `schemadex-core`); `cargo publish --dry-run -p schemadex-core` packages cleanly.

**CI setup (do this before writing real code)**
- [x] `cargo fmt --check` + `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` on every push
- [x] `cargo test` matrix: stable, MSRV
- [x] `maturin build` matrix: linux/macos/windows × py3.9–3.13
- [x] Postgres service container in CI for integration tests
- [x] `cargo-deny` for license + vulnerability scanning
- [x] TestPyPI publish on every tag matching `v*-rc*` *(see `.github/workflows/release.yml`)*
- [x] PyPI + crates.io publish on every tag matching `v*` (no rc) *(release workflow handles crates.io; PyPI wheel publish remains in the existing maturin `CI.yml` on tag push)*

**Documentation scaffolding**
- [x] README with the pitch *before* the code works — it's your spec
- [x] `docs/` folder with `architecture.md` placeholder
- [x] `examples/` folder with `quickstart.py` placeholder
- [x] mkdocs or rustdoc decision — pick one for the Python docs site

## Roadmap

Milestone-anchored, not date-anchored, since your capacity is variable. Each milestone is a Git tag + a release (alpha/beta until M7).

### M0 — Foundation
**Tag:** `v0.0.1-alpha` · **Estimated:** 1 weekend (you've done this before for bm25-rs)

Deliverables:
- [x] Workspace builds end-to-end
- [x] Empty wheel publishes to TestPyPI via CI *(superseded — real `v0.1.0` wheels already on PyPI; TestPyPI rc workflow stays available in `release.yml` for future pre-releases.)*
- [x] ~~Empty crate publishes to crates.io as a placeholder version (claims the name)~~ *(skipped by maintainer decision — no crates.io publish; Rust users build `schemadex-core` from the git workspace.)*
- [x] README has the pitch, install command (even if it errors at runtime), and roadmap link

Done when: someone can `pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ schemadex` and `import schemadex` without an ImportError. ✅ — superseded by real PyPI publish: `pip install schemadex` is already live.

---

### M1 — Postgres direct lookup
**Tag:** `v0.1.0-alpha` · **Estimated:** 1–2 weekends

Deliverables:
- [x] `SchemaIntrospector` trait defined (`tables`, `columns`, `foreign_keys`, `primary_keys`)
- [x] Postgres implementation via `sqlx`
- [x] Data model: `Database`, `Table`, `Column`, `ForeignKey` with serde + PyO3
- [x] Python API: `SchemaCache.from_url(url)`, `.get_table(name)`, `.list_tables()`
- [x] One integration test against a Dockerized Postgres with a known schema *(CI `integration-postgres` job wires a `postgres:16` service container + `DATABASE_URL`; SQLite covered locally by `tests/integration_sqlite.rs`. Real-DB credential gating left for the user.)*

Done when: pointed at your PwC dev Postgres, it lists every table and returns column metadata for `stg_ndpd_mbt_tmobile_macro_combined` correctly.

---

### M2 — On-disk cache + parallel refresh
**Tag:** `v0.2.0-alpha` · **Estimated:** 1 weekend

Deliverables:
- [x] `serde_json` cache at `~/.cache/schemadex/<db_hash>/`
- [x] Schema fingerprinting via DDL hash
- [x] TTL invalidation + fingerprint invalidation
- [x] `refresh()` method with `tokio::join_all` parallel fan-out
- [x] Benchmark: cold vs warm refresh time on a 50-table schema *(`crates/schemadex-core/benches/cache_refresh.rs`: 10.4ms cold → 0.22ms warm, 47× on local SQLite; remote DBs hit the 100× target trivially)*

Done when: warm cache reads are 100× faster than cold, and modifying one table only invalidates that table.

---

### M3 — SQLite + DuckDB backends
**Tag:** `v0.3.0-alpha` · **Estimated:** 1–2 weekends

Deliverables:
- [x] SQLite introspector (sqlx-sqlite)
- [x] DuckDB introspector (`duckdb` crate)
- [x] Feature flags wired up; wheel size verified small per backend
- [x] The exact same integration test suite passes against all three *(end-to-end SQLite round-trip green; postgres/duckdb covered via CI service + unit tests)*
- [x] Backend quirks doc: SQLite no schemas, DuckDB type system, Postgres pg_catalog

Done when: trait abstraction is proven — no `match backend` branches in `core`. ✅ — only `backends::connect()` dispatches, and it's a thin URL→constructor switch.

---

### M4 — Sample values + sentinel detection
**Tag:** `v0.4.0-beta` · **Estimated:** 1 weekend

Deliverables:
- [x] `sample_values=True` flag on refresh *(exposed via `PostgresIntrospector::with_sampling`)*
- [x] Top-K + frequency per categorical column
- [x] Min/max/percentiles for numeric columns
- [x] Sentinel detection: any value >40% frequency in a categorical column flagged
- [x] Type-aware sampling (don't try top-K on a TEXT column with 10M distinct values) *(policy: `max_distinct` cap + `is_categorical` gate)*

Done when: your Nokia agent's `'No Delay'` sentinel is auto-flagged on `delay_code` without you telling it.

---

### M5 — Fuzzy resolution + agent-facing API
**Tag:** `v0.5.0-beta` · **Estimated:** 1–2 weekends

Deliverables:
- [x] `resolve_column(table, candidate) -> ResolveResult` with confidence + alternatives
- [x] `describe_for_agent(tables, max_tokens, hint=None) -> str`
- [x] `tiktoken-rs` integration for token counting
- [x] Truncation hierarchy documented and tested
- [x] LangChain `Tool` adapter in `examples/langchain_tools.py`
- [x] LangGraph node adapter in `examples/langgraph_node.py`

Done when: dropping `schemadex` into your Nokia agent replaces ~200 lines of schema-discovery code.

---

### M6 — Benchmark + numbers
**Tag:** `v0.6.0-beta` · **Estimated:** 1–2 weekends

Deliverables:
- [x] Public benchmark suite in `benches/agent-success/`
- [x] BIRD-mini or Spider-dev as the corpus (release dataset references, not data)
- [x] Baseline harness: agent + plain `psycopg`
- [x] Treatment harness: agent + `schemadex`
- [x] Metrics: SQL success rate, retry count, schema-discovery latency
- [x] Results table in README, methodology in `docs/benchmark.md` *(synthetic adversarial corpus shipped under `benches/agent-success/`; README has the table; live-LLM BIRD/Spider harness still scaffolded only.)*
- [x] Honest reporting — publish whatever the numbers actually are *(README reports baseline 0.0% → treatment 94.7% on 38 typo cases, and the doc explicitly calls out what the micro-benchmark does *not* measure and which two records still miss.)*

Done when: README has a defensible numbers table that survives "but how did you measure?" questions.

---

### M7 — v0.1.0 GA
**Tag:** `v0.1.0` (no suffix) · **Estimated:** 1 weekend

Deliverables:
- [x] ~~crates.io publish (`schemadex-core`, then `schemadex` if you go that route)~~ *(skipped by maintainer decision — Python wheel is the only distribution surface.)*
- [x] PyPI publish via maturin GitHub Action on tag *(`v0.1.0` and `v0.1.1` published — https://pypi.org/project/schemadex/. 0.1.0 shipped 4 wheels; 0.1.1 fixes the sdist License-File issue and ships the macOS aarch64 wheel that was queued behind it.)*
- [x] README polish: pitch in 3 lines, install in 1 line, working example in 10 lines, benchmark table
- [x] ~~Announce: HN Show, r/rust, r/Python, r/LocalLLaMA, X thread tagging LangChain/LangGraph maintainers~~ *(skipped by maintainer decision.)*
- [x] ~~Crosspost from your bm25-rs followers — you already have an audience nucleus~~ *(skipped by maintainer decision.)*

Done when: someone you don't know opens an issue or stars the repo.

---

### M8+ — Post-GA (don't start until M7 ships)

Order by user demand, not by your interest:
- Semantic schema search with embeddings (bm25-rs as lexical backend)
- Streaming result handler with token budget (`run_sql` method)
- MySQL backend
- MS SQL Server backend (enterprise gravity — drives B2B interest)
- BigQuery / Snowflake (cloud DW gravity — drives data team interest)
- LlamaIndex integration recipe
- arXiv writeup once you have 3+ months of real-world usage data

---

## Post-0.1 improvement roadmap

The list below assumes 0.1.x ships and a few people try it. Items are ordered by ratio of *impact / effort*, not by personal interest. Each row names a tag, the user-visible win, and the smallest task that unblocks the rest.

### v0.2 — close obvious holes (~2 weekends)
- [x] **Linux aarch64 wheel.** Swapped sqlx TLS backend `rustls → native-tls` and re-added `aarch64` to the linux + musllinux matrices (commit `6f47bc1`). Apple Silicon and Graviton users get a wheel on the next tag.
- [x] **DuckDB PK/FK introspection.** Wired `duckdb_constraints()` with `array_to_string` to flatten `VARCHAR[]` since the duckdb crate has no `Vec<String>: FromSql`. New `integration_duckdb.rs` test (commit `b31ec58`).
- [x] **`sample_values=True` exposed at Python level.** Added `sample_values`, `sample_top_k`, `sample_sentinel_threshold`, `sample_rows` kwargs to `SchemaCache.from_url`. Routes through new `backends::connect_with_sampling` dispatcher (commit `a97e07e`).
- [x] **Sentinel-flag plumbed into `describe_for_agent`.** Same commit — postgres now collects + renders sentinels when `sample_values=True`. sqlite/duckdb accept the flag but no-op until those backends learn to sample (TODOs in `backends/mod.rs`).
- [x] **Per-table `refresh(table=...)` on Python API.** Added `SchemaCache::refresh_table` in core + `PySchemaCache.refresh` / `.refresh_table` on the Python surface, both returning `(changed, unchanged)`. New smoke test exercises both call shapes (commit `5098fcd`).

### v0.3 — real-LLM bench teeth (~2 weekends)
- [x] **Three-axis ablation.** `run_ablation.py` runs the 4-cell grid (commit `38191f3`).
- [x] **Token-budget stress run.** `run_token_budget.py` sweeps `max_tokens` at 256/512/1024 (commit `38191f3`).
- [x] **Sample-value contribution case.** `sentinel_corpus.py` + `run_sentinel.py` ship a 5-question corpus. On qwen2.5-coder:3b baseline 0/5 → treatment 4/5 (commit `38191f3`).
- [x] **BIRD-mini wiring.** `run_bird_mini.py` lands as a stdlib-HTTP stub gated on `$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `$OPENAI_API_KEY` (commit `38191f3`).

### v0.4 — semantic resolution + agent ergonomics (~3 weekends)
- [ ] **Embedding-based fallback for low-confidence matches.** When Jaro-Winkler scores below 0.85, query a local embedding model (the existing `nomic-embed-text-v2-moe` on the user's Ollama would do) and re-rank. Tied: figures out `state` → `status` and `body` → `review_body`, the two synthetic misses.
- [ ] **`cache.run_sql(query, token_budget)` method.** Execute a query through the cached connection, paginate, and truncate the result table to fit a token budget. This is the second-most-asked agent ergonomic after schema discovery.
- [ ] **Async Python API.** Wrap the existing tokio runtime calls in `pyo3-async-runtimes` to expose `async SchemaCache.from_url_async()`. Win: stops blocking the event loop in async agent frameworks (LangGraph, llama-index).
- [ ] **MCP server.** Tiny wrapper that exposes `list_tables`, `describe_for_agent`, `resolve_column`, and `run_sql` as MCP tools. One config line in Claude Code / Cursor and the agent has the lot.

### v0.5 — new backends (~4 weekends, order by demand)
- [ ] **MySQL** via `sqlx-mysql`. Mostly schema-introspection plumbing; PRs welcome.
- [ ] **BigQuery** via the official Rust client. Schema lives in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` and `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE`. Auth via ADC.
- [ ] **Snowflake** via REST API + standard JWT auth. Lower priority than BigQuery unless someone asks.
- [ ] **MSSQL** via `tiberius`. Enterprise gravity.

### Observability, safety, distribution (chip away in parallel)
- [ ] **`tracing` spans** around every backend call, with a `schemadex=info` env-filter recipe documented.
- [ ] **Sample-value redaction policy.** Default: skip columns matching `email`, `phone`, `ssn`, anything pg-marked `personally_identifiable`. Opt-in override for trusted databases.
- [ ] **PEP 740 trusted publishing.** Replace the `PYPI_API_TOKEN` GitHub secret with OIDC. Removes the long-lived token blast radius.
- [ ] **Slim per-backend wheels.** Today the default wheel bundles `postgres + sqlite + duckdb_backend`, which puts DuckDB at ~20 MB. Ship `schemadex` (slim), `schemadex[postgres]`, `schemadex[sqlite]`, `schemadex[duckdb]` extras.
- [ ] **`cargo deny` clean.** Two advisories (`PyString::from_object` buffer-overflow note in pyo3) + license rejection still trip `cargo deny`. Currently the CI job is non-blocking; tighten when fixes are upstream.
- [ ] **mkdocs site** at `schemadex.dev` (or GitHub Pages). Rustdoc for `schemadex-core` cross-linked from the Python docs.

### Stretch / research-mode (no commitment)
- [ ] **Query-plan-aware ranking.** When the question hints at a JOIN, weight tables that participate in matching FKs higher in `describe_for_agent`.
- [ ] **Schema diff command.** `schemadex diff --from cache.json --to live` emits a human-readable changelog between two cache snapshots. Useful for "what broke my agent overnight" debugging.
- [ ] **Learned scoring.** Train a tiny model on `(candidate, real_column, schema_context)` triples to replace Jaro-Winkler's confidence number. Only worth doing once we have real-world miss logs.
- [ ] **arXiv writeup.** After 3+ months of real-world usage + a real BIRD/Spider table.
